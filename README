Extract the Main Content of a webpage.

Requirements:

- BeautifulSoup 4
- html5lib / lxml (*)

Basic Usage:

    >>> bs = Briticle()
    >>> bs.open('http://example.com/blog-post-url/')
    >>> print bs.text # the main content
    >>> print bs.html # the main content with html tags

* Required by BeautifulSoup 4 to parser some pages. If not, HTMLParseError may occur.
* You can choose either of them, both can pass the unit tests (Run it to make sure it is).
* I am using lxml, it's faster.
