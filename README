Fetch blog articles via URLs.

Requirements:

- BeautifulSoup 4
- html5lib / lxml (*)

NOTE:

This libiray does NOT suppose to be working perfectly, which is not possible. Everyone may difine divs in pages in every strange ways. You may take a look at Readability if you interested: http://www.readability.com/publishers/api/

* Required by BeautifulSoup 4 to parser some pages. If not, HTMLParseError may occur.
* You can choose either of them, both can pass the unit tests (Run it to make sure it is).
* I am using lxml, it's faster.
