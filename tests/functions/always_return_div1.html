<p><strong>Pirating to learn</strong></p>
<p>The world, it should not come as a surprise, is filled with people who want desperately to learn.&nbsp;This is what our world should be filled with. This is what scholars work hard to create: a world of reading, learning, thinking and scholarship.&nbsp;The users of library.nu were would-be scholars:&nbsp;those in the outer atmosphere of learning who wanted to know, argue, dispute, experiment and write just as those in the universities do.</p>
<p>So what does the shutdown of library.nu mean? The publishers think it is a great success in the war on piracy; that it will lead to more revenue and more control over who buys what, if not who reads what. The pirates - the people who create and run such sites - think that shutting down library.nu will only lead to a thousand more sites, stronger and better than before.</p>
<p>But both are missing the point: the global demand for learning and scholarship is not being met by the contemporary publishing industry. It cannot be, not with the current business models and the prices. The users of library.nu - these barbarians at the gate of the publishing industry and the university - are legion.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing is caring</strong></p>
<p>Library.nu was making that learning possible where publishers have not. It made a good show of being a "book review" site - it was called library.nu after all, and not "bookstore.nu".&nbsp;It was not cluttered with advertisements, nor did it "suggest" other books constantly. It gave straight answers to straightforward searches, and provided user reviews of the 400,000 or more books in the database.</p>
