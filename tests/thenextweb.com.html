    <p>Thomas Suarez is in the 6th grade at a middle school in the South Bay. And while most of his peers are probably fussing over new soccer kleets or watching the Disney channel, he&#8217;s creating iOS apps and giving TED Talks.</p>
    <p>Knowing that human beings such as Suarez exist makes me really hopeful and excited for the future. Watch his TED Talk from the recent TEDx conference in Manhattan Beach below. There are more great finds from around the Internet every day at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables">TNW Shareables</a>.</p>
